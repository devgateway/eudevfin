		Regional projects and
		programmes are reportable under the most specific available 'regional/multi-country' category (e.g. use
		South of Sahara
		for a regional project in West Africa).
		The category “bilateral, unallocated” is used if an activity benefits several
		regions.
		It is also used for a number of activities undertaken in donor countries such as administrative costs not
		included
		elsewhere.
		Development-related research, studies or seminars undertaken in the donor country but relating to a
		particular recipient country/region
		should be coded under the recipient country/region.
		Training courses in the donor
		country for developing country participants should be coded under the country/countries of
		origin of the participants.</entry>

	<entry key="7bCPA.help.detail">Field no. 7 bis - Is this Country Programmable Aid (CPA)?: Country Programmable Aid (CPA) reflects the
		amount of aid that can be programmed by the donor at partner country level.
		CPA is aid which is NOT included in the
		following categories: (i) aid that is unpredictable by nature (humanitarian aid
		and debt forgiveness and
		reorganisation);
		(ii) entails no cross-border flows (development research in donor country, promotion of development
		awareness, imputed student
		costs, refugees in donor country and administrative costs);
                (iii) does not form part of
		co-operation agreements between
		governments (food aid and aid extended by local governments in donor countries); (iv) is not
		country programmable by the
		donor (core funding to national NGOs and International NGOs), or is not susceptible for
		programming at country level
		(e.g. contributions to Public Private Partnerships, for some donors aid extended by other
		agencies than the main aid
		agency). For more info go to

		contributions should be recorded unless the recipient agency is included in the list. However, multilateral
		organisations not listed can still serve as channels of delivery for bilateral ODA-eligible contributions. The channel
		of delivery is the first implementing partner. It is the entity that has implementing responsibility over the funds
		and is normally linked to the extending agency (the agency you work for) by a contract or other binding agreement, and
		is directly accountable to it. In the case of use by the central aid authorities of other public sector agencies in
		the donor country for implementation of specific activities, report “donor government” as the channel of delivery. For
		a detailed classification of the channel of delivery main categories see paragraph 119 on page 29 of the CRS Reporitng

		directly with a developing country. They also encompass transactions with non-governmental organisations active in
		development and other,internal development-related transactions such as interest subsidies, spending on promotion of
		development awareness, debt reorganisation and administrative costs. The definition of a multilateral contribution is
		based on two criteria: (i) the multilateral character of the recipient institution and (i) the multilateral character
		of the contribution (e.g. funds are pooled so that they lose their identity and become an integral part of the
		recipient institution’s financial assets). Donors’ contributions that satisfy both criteria should be recorded under
		the heading "multilateral": Your public agency is requested to use Bi/Multi values 1-3 (or 7), while private sector
		agencies should use value 6.

		incurred by the recipient. For ODA reporting purposes, they also include forgiveness of non-military debt; support to
		non-governmental organisations; certain interest subsidies and certain costs incurred in the implementation of aid.
		Grants to multilateral agencies intended to soften the terms of the latter’s lending are a direct resource outflow and
		should also be recorded as ODA grants. For OOF reporting purposes, grants for commercial purposes such as subsidies to
		national private investors, and grants to forgive military debt, are also included. Two other types of finance are
		assimilated to grants in DAC statistics: i) Capital subscriptions are payments to multilateral agencies in the form of
		notes and similar instruments, unconditionally encashable at sight by the recipient institutions; ii) Grant-like flows
		comprise a) loans for which the service payments are to be made into an account in the borrowing country and used in
		the borrowing country for its own benefit, and b) provision of commodities for sale in the recipient’s currency the
		proceeds of which are used in the recipient country for its own benefit. For a complete list of sub-types and
